# StealthOpsKit Overview
StealthOpsKit is a comprehensive cybersecurity framework developed as part of the [Zsecurity.org course](https://www.udemy.com/learn-python-and-ethical-hacking-from-scratch/). The goal of this project is to integrate various cybersecurity tools and techniques into a cohesive system, addressing a broad range of cybersecurity needs.

## Tools and Techniques

### 1. Mac Changer
The **Mac Changer** tool allows us to alter the MAC address of network interfaces. This can be useful for anonymity and bypassing MAC address-based filters or restrictions.

### 2. Network Scanner
Our **Network Scanner** helps in identifying active devices on a network, their IP addresses, and additional network-related information. This is essential for network mapping and vulnerability assessment.

### 3. ARP Spoofing
**ARP Spoofing** (or ARP poisoning) is used to intercept network traffic by sending falsified ARP messages. This technique can be used for man-in-the-middle attacks or to gather information about network traffic.

### 4. Packet Sniffing
**Packet Sniffing** involves capturing and analyzing network packets to gather data that can be used for troubleshooting, monitoring, or conducting security assessments.

### 5. DNS Spoofing
**DNS Spoofing** (or DNS cache poisoning) is used to redirect DNS queries to malicious sites or alter DNS responses. This can be useful for redirecting traffic or conducting phishing attacks.

### 6. JavaScript Injector (Coming Soon)
**JavaScript Injector** will allow for the injection of custom JavaScript code into web pages. This can be used for testing, exploiting vulnerabilities, or altering web page behavior.

### 7. Bypass HTTPS (Coming Soon)
**Bypass HTTPS** techniques will be implemented to exploit weaknesses in HTTPS implementations or to intercept HTTPS traffic. This is critical for understanding and addressing HTTPS security issues.

### 8. ARP Spoof Detector
**ARP Spoof Detector** is designed to detect ARP spoofing attacks on a network. It helps in identifying unauthorized ARP responses and protecting the network from potential attacks.

### 9. Malwares (Coming Soon)
**Malwares** functionality will be incorporated to analyze and detect malicious software. This feature will help in understanding malware behavior and enhancing security measures.

### 10. Web Crawler
Our **Web Crawler** will automatically browse and gather information from websites. This is useful for information gathering, vulnerability scanning, and indexing web content.

### 11. BruteForce - LoginForm (Coming Soon)
**BruteForce - LoginForm** will be used to test the strength of login forms by attempting various username and password combinations. This will help in assessing the security of authentication mechanisms.

### 12. Vulnerability Scanner (Coming Soon)
**Vulnerability Scanner** will be integrated to identify security vulnerabilities in systems and applications. It will assist in finding weaknesses and improving overall security posture.

## Project Vision
The goal of StealthOpsKit is to develop a powerful cybersecurity framework that integrates these tools and techniques into a cohesive system. The framework is designed to address various aspects of network security, vulnerability assessment, and threat detection.

## Future Development
With the [Zsecurity.org course](https://www.udemy.com/learn-python-and-ethical-hacking-from-scratch/) course completed, we will continue to enhance StealthOpsKit by adding new functionalities and refining existing tools. Stay tuned for updates on new features and improvements.
